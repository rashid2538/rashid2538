I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for creating robust and scalable applications. I have experience working with a variety of programming languages including:

- JavaScript 🌐
- PHP 🐘
- C# ☕️
- Python 🐍

My expertise in front-end technologies like React, Angular, and Vue.js, combined with my knowledge of back-end frameworks like MVC .NET, Node.js, and Laravel, enables me to build end-to-end solutions that meet the needs of my clients.

## Latest Technologies

I'm always staying up-to-date with the latest technological advancements and experimenting with new tools and frameworks. Here are a few of my latest technology interests:

- **Artificial Intelligence** - I believe that AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries and I'm excited to be a part of this movement.
- **Serverless** - Serverless architecture is becoming increasingly popular and I'm interested in exploring how it can be used to build scalable and cost-effective applications.
- **Blockchain** - I'm fascinated by the potential of blockchain technology and the opportunities it presents for creating decentralized applications.
